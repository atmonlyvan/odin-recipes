        <h3>Description :</h3>
        <p>Though Satay Chicken is better known as Thai or Malaysian food, it actually originated from Indonesia and the Indonesian version is by far the simplest. The Peanut Sauce is my own - refer to the notes for why I prefer this to the authentic version. It is thick so it is great for dolloping, rather than a thin dipping sauce. Satay Chicken is fabulous for outdoor BBQ's, parties and for fast midweek meals! They also reheat really well in the microwave. They can be cooked on the outdoor grill, on the stove or under the grill/broiler.</p>

        <h3>Instructions :</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h5>CHICKEN</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Cut the chicken into 1.5cm/0.5" cubes. Thread onto skewers - 4 to 5 pieces per skewer.</li>
                    <li>Combine kecap manis and butter, then brush onto chicken.</li>
                    <li>Cook the skewers on a hot BBQ (outdoor grill) or on the stove in a large non stick fry pan (add a splash of oil, and make sure the skewers will fit in the pan). Grill/broiler would also work.</li>
                    <li>Serve, garnished with crushed peanuts, shallots and with lime wedges and Peanut Sauce on the side.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h5>PEANUT SAUCE</h5>
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat oil in a small saucepan over medium high heat. Add garlic, onion and chillis and cook for 3 minutes until onion is translucent.</li>
                    <li>Turn heat down to medium, then add peanut butter, coconut milk, kecap manis, soy sauce and salt. Simmer for 10 minutes, whisking occasionally.</li>
                    <li>Use a handheld stick to puree (so the onion and chilli blends throughout the sauce - this is key). (See Note 2 for blending instructions) Stir through crushed peanuts and lime juice and simmer for 2 minutes. Allow to cool slightly before serving or to room temperature - it will thicken.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ul>
